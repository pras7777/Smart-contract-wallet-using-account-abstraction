- Users can send and receive funds through their wallet.
- Users can view their wallet balances.

### Implementation Details

- The smart contract is based on Solidity.
- Implements the functionalities as per EIP-4337 standards.
- Utilizes Testnet for testing purposes.

### Usage

1. Deploy the `SmartWallet` contract to an Ethereum Testnet.
2. Access the provided front-end interface to interact with the deployed contract.
3. Users can create a wallet, send and receive funds, and view their wallet balances.

### Smart Contract Details

#### `SmartWallet.sol`

This Solidity contract facilitates the creation and management of user wallets.

### Front-end Interface

The front-end interface provides a simple form where users can input an Ethereum address and view its balance.

### Technologies Used

- Solidity
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Web3.js (for interacting with Ethereum)

### Testing
